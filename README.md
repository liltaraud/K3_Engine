# K3_Engine

The bases of the C++ Vulkan based engine I am currently building.
Based on the [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) from Alexander Overvoorde.                                                     

Currently is only capable of drawing indexed vertices in 2D. I am working on creating an object that handles all the systems that relate to Vertex buffer creation and handling to ease the rendering of various scenes.
